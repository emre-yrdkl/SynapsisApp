# Synapsis Mobile Application

## Overview

**Synapsis** is a mobile application designed to bridge digital and physical social interactions by creating virtual locations tied to real-world places. Leveraging advanced GPS technology and user-generated content, Synapsis enhances social experiences and interactions within specific venues such as cafes, restaurants, and other social spots.

With Synapsis, users can:

* Create personalized profiles.
* Explore a real-time map with access to various locations.
* Interact within private, distinct places that foster meaningful connections based on the type of venue.

## Key Features

1. **Personalized Profiles**: Customize your profile with interests, photos, and personal details to create a rich social identity.
2. **Real-Time Map**: Explore nearby locations, see who's checked in, and join or create virtual interactions at physical venues.
3. **Private Spaces**: Engage in social interactions within private, distinct places. Build stronger connections in familiar environments like cafes or restaurants.
4. **Recommendation System**:
   * **Interest-Based Matching**: Users are initially matched based on shared interests.
   * **NLP Model Matching**: If interests align, an NLP model refines the matching process by evaluating the semantic similarity of user profiles to ensure highly relevant and personalized connections.
5. **User-Generated Content**: Share photos, updates, and engage with others in the appâ€™s social ecosystem.
